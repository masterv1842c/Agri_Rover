üìå Overview
This project is a smart agriculture robot designed to automate seed sowing, fertilizer dispensing, and ploughing, while avoiding obstacles and being remotely controlled via Bluetooth. It‚Äôs ideal for small to mid-scale farms and aims to reduce manual labor and increase efficiency in farming operations.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
‚úÖ Autonomous seed sowing at regular intervals

‚úÖ Fertilizer dispensing pump with controlled timing

‚úÖ Servo-based ploughing mechanism for accurate soil tilting

‚úÖ Bluetooth control for navigation and remote operations

‚úÖ Obstacle detection using IR sensors to avoid collisions

‚úÖ Multi-directional movement (Forward, Backward, Turns, Diagonal)

‚úÖ Integrated motor shield (Adafruit) for better motor control

üß† Working Principle
1. Movement & Navigation
The robot uses 4 DC motors connected to the Adafruit Motor Shield to move in various directions.

Based on Bluetooth commands (F, B, L, R, etc.), the motors move forward, backward, or turn.

2. Ploughing Mechanism
A servo motor lifts or lowers the plough.

When moving forward/backward, the plough is lowered to till the soil.

When turning, the plough is lifted to prevent soil disturbance.

3. Seed Sowing
A servo motor connected to a seed dispenser drops seeds at regular intervals (every 2 seconds).

It moves to a 90¬∞ position to release the seed, then back to 0¬∞.

4. Fertilizer Dispensing
A water pump is turned ON after each seed is released, running for a set duration (3 seconds) to pour fertilizer.

5. Obstacle Detection
2 IR sensors (left and right) detect obstacles:

If both detect, the robot stops.

If only one detects, the robot turns left or right to avoid the object.
